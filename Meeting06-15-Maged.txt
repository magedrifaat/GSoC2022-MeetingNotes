Points Covered:
    - Adding my files to octave: m files in appropriate scripts subdirectory
        (io for the tiff class) and internal functions in libintrep/dldfcn
    - Making libtiff optional: assume it is available for now, revisit it later
        to add the needed configurations
    - Bookmarks are the common way to branching in mercurial, branches are for
        heavier parallel projects and are not as lightweight as in git.

Action Points:
    - Add links in notes readme for the fork repo and the POCs repo
    - Add the new classdef to the octave build system
    - Find a better way to keep the Tiff handle around (Ask in forums)
    - Finish implementing getTag for different tag data types.
    - Implement setTag.

Next Meeting: Wednesday 13:00 UTC+1
