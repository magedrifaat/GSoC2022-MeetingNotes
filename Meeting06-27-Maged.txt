Points Covered:
    - Minimum details to conform with octave coding style
    - Ignore Tiff extensions for now (e.g. geotiff)
    - GrayResponseCurve and GrayResponseUnit are used to map
       grayscale pixels to values similar to ColorMap for palette images
    - Presentation next Friday for 5 minutes

Action Points:
    - Add entry in configure.ac for libtiff
    - Fix formatting of code to be consistent with octave
    - Check the correct return type for scalars
    - Test special tags by creating suitable tiff files
    - Make a map for tags supported outside of libtiff
    - Add explicit comments about undocumented tags
    - Make note of all the things to be implemented later
    - Prepare a 5 min Presentation about the project
        - The problem: pros and cons of GraphicsMagcik
        - The solution: libtiff
        - The scope: Tiff class then im* functions
        - Progress so far
    - Start Working on setTag
    - Add my weekly website post

Next Meeting: Wednesday 13:00 UTC+1
