Points Covered:
    - Making the first line of a commit less ambiguous.
    - The most efficient method of reading images
      (read as fast as possible from LibTIFF then do necessary
       matrix transformations to reach the octave formatting).
    - Writing tests that generate their on images to reduce size.

Action Points:
    - Finish implementing the read function.
    - Test HAVE_TIFF by disabling tiff from the configure script.
    - Check the correct output for images with GrayResponseCurve.
    - Check if an empty image (no IFD or IFDs with no image data)
      is permitted and use it to write tests.
    - Ask on forums for testing on different machines.

Next meeting: Wednesday the 18th 13:00 UTC+1
