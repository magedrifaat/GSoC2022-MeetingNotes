Points Covered:
    - Octave handling multi-page images with different dimensions/color configurations:
        each image should be returned as a matrix depending on its own 
        configuration (rows x columns x channels).
    - BigTiff support: Default in libtiff >= 4.0 (shouldn't use any earlier version).
    - Libtiff accessing large number of pages is worse than O(n).
    - There may be a regular meeting with all GSoC mentors/contributors.
    - Our meetings will be Monday and Wednesday every week at 13:00 UTC+1.

Action Points:
    - Add the meeting link and a file with dates I am not available to the notes repo.
    - Start working on the classdef for Tiff (retrieving tags).
    - Set up the hosting repository from Octave.
    - Set up a separate repo for the POCs (Github)
    - Work on POC to write a Tiff file with multiple pages (10, 100, 1000, ...)
      with empty or single pixel bitmaps and check performance.

Next meeting: Wednesday 13:00 UTC+1
