Points Covered:
    - If i am doing something in a non-conventional way I should leave
      a comment to explain it to save time for future maintainers.
    - GNU Readline tool used in Octave and many types of terminals.

Action Points:
    - Finish implementing the read function (support float and YCbCr).
    - Use matrix transpose, permute and reshape instead of pointer math to
      put image data in its right form.
    - Convert ColorMap to double, check other tags that may need conversion.
    - Move image_data inititalization to a constructor.
    - Remove support for read header mode to avoid image state with no IFD.
    - Test 4-bit grayscale images.
    - Check if orientation tag should affect return data of read.
