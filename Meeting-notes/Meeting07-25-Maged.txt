Points Covered:
    - 4-bit images and 16-bit floating-point images are not
      common and can be postponed for later or ignored.
    - libinterp function can't be used from oct files and
      dldfcns while liboctave functions can.
    - Bugs related to Tiff in the bug tracker can be closed
      after the end of this project.

Action Points:
    - Write tests for implemented functions
    - Look into moving bitpack to liboctave
    - Finish implementing writeEncodedStrip
    - Look into magick read functions modifications to use matrix
      operations and measure performance differece
