Points Covered:
    - Code that deviates from matlab's behavior should have comments
      explaining, as well as code that handles a special case for 
      matlab compatibility.
    - Using constant values for data in testing is better than generating
      random numbers for repeatability.

Action Points:
    - Add weekly post
    - Write tests for implemented functions
    - Look into moving bitpack to liboctave
    - Finish implementing writeEncodedStrip
    - Look into magick read functions modifications to use matrix
      operations and measure performance differece
