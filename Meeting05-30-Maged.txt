Points Covered:
    - POC classdef creation working by modifying octave internals
    - No OOP from C++ side (start simple and adapt to use cases in the future)
    - My updates about the project will be through personal website
    - My Repo will be hosted on osdn.net

Action Points:
    - Write the classdef creation POC using an oct file (ask in the forums)
    - Look into octave differentiating classes from constructors
    - Set up my personal website
    - Read about autotools and octave build configurations
    - Work on POC to read the number of pages and the dimensions of each
      page of a Tiff file from C++ and from Octave (file I/O)
