Points Covered:
    - Array::cat is the function that Octave uses to concatenate matrices.
    - All cases need to be noted so we can make a test case for them later
    - Support for YCbCr will be postponed for later in favor of the functions
      needed for writing tests

Action Points:
    - Add weekly website post.
    - Finish implementing the read function (support float and signed int).
    - Remove support for read header mode.
    - Mark "r+" mode as not supported for now.
    - Test 4-bit grayscale images.
    - Check if orientation tag should affect return data of read.
    - Implement functions necessary for writing tests.
    - Make a table of functions or features, what is done and what remains,
      with any comments about the features and a rough timeline.
    - Add documentation for the classdef so print_usage can be used

Next meeting: Monday 13:00 UTC+1
